## Welcome to Systems Thinking

ChatGPT summary: [Systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking) is an approach to problem-solving that considers the relationships and interactions between different components of a system. It involves understanding the interconnectedness of the parts of a system and the way they work together to produce a particular outcome.

In systems thinking, problems are viewed as part of a larger system rather than as isolated issues. This approach recognizes that changes made to one part of a system can have unintended consequences elsewhere, and that a holistic view is necessary to truly understand and solve complex problems.

Systems thinking involves several key principles, including identifying feedback loops, understanding the role of structure in shaping behavior, recognizing the importance of mental models and assumptions, and considering multiple perspectives.

Overall, systems thinking provides a powerful framework for analyzing and understanding complex issues and developing effective solutions that address the underlying causes of problems rather than just treating the symptoms.
